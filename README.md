# MECH103-MATLAB-Algorithms

This repository includes codes that I made in my Mech 103 class

## This includes:
1. A code to make an Arduino play music
2. A code to make an Arduino tell distance
3. A code to make an Arudino into an intruder systems

## These codes require:
- An arduino that is set up for the code
- Possible minor adjustements to code based on where your pins are connected
