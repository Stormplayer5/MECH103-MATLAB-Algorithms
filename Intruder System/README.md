## This code allows for you to use your Arduino as an Intruder Alert System

This is the most complicated code in this repository.  This uses a button, the ultrasonic sensor, LED Lights, and a speaker in conjuction with your Arduio


## This code requires:
- That you already have an arduino set up
- Possible Modifications to the code by person based on pin location

## To use:
1. Download IntruderSystem_finalProjectTwo.m to open it in MATLAB (Or copy and paste the code)
2. Set up the system on an elevated surface.  Through experimentation I found that between 28.5 and 39.5 inches off the ground works best
3. Run the program
4. When an intruder goes through the sensor, it will set off the lights and a noise.  To stop this, simply press the button
